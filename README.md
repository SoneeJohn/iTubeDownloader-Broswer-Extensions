# iTubeDownloader-Broswer-Extensions
Web Browser Extension used my iTubeDownloader


## Installation

1. Download the extension source code [here]()
2. Store the extension on disk (do not delete it as Chrome will read it's content to run the extension, a good place to place this folder is in your `Documents` folder)
3. Open this [link](chrome://extensions) in Google Chrome
4. In the top right-hand corner, turn on *Developer mode*, then click *Load unpacked*, select the folder that youâ€™ve downloaded and saved in Step 1 and confirm.
